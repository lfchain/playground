            <br><br>
            My beloved Ofsi, HuaHua 🌸,
            <br><br>
            Winter in Hokkaido lays a quiet, snow-bright veil of frost and stillness; 
            spring in Florida pushes through with early warmth, blooming palms and azaleas, 
            turning dormancy into bursts of green; summer in Xinjiang stretches time 
            into long, sunlit days of heat and ripening fields; autumn in Bali cools 
            the light and layers the landscape in deep, tropical hues as rains shift and 
            leaves and fruit fall. We together witnessed the change of seasons, and both grown 
            with it in this journey.
            <br><br>
            This past year, we have grown much closer together, sharing our thoughts 
            and experiences as the seasons changed around us. I have learned a lot more 
            about you this year,
            <br> how to handle your quirks and preferences,
            <br> what makes you happy and sad (even though I may not always understand why but I am trying).
            <br> how to better support you when you are down (I am here for you, always).
            <br> how to celebrate your successes, no matter how small (I am so proud of you this year for all of your accomplishments!!!).
            <br> and most importantly, how to love you better each day.
            <br><br>
            As you have mentioned many times already, I am somewhat childish at times, but I 
            hope you can see the sincerity and depth of my feelings for you. I am constantly learning 
            and growing, and I am grateful to have you by my side on this journey. You make me a better person,
            and I sure hope that I do the same for you.
            <br><br>
            You are my sunshine on a cloudy day, my comfort when I need support, and 
            my best friend in all things. Thanks for an amazing 2025, and please allow me to
            hold your hands as we step into 2026 together.
            <br><br>
            With all my love,
            <br>
